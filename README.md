# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game

This project was developed as a part of my learning journey in Python. It served as a hands-on exercise to reinforce my understanding of Python programming concepts and GUI development using Tkinter. 
This repository contains a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game built using Python's Tkinter library. The game allows users to play against the computer and displays the result of each round.

## Description

The game's interface is developed using Tkinter, providing a user-friendly window-based interaction. Upon launching the game, users can choose between 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' by entering their choice in the provided text box and clicking the 'PLAY' button. The computer generates a random choice, and the game displays the result - whether the user wins, loses, or if it's a tie.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```
   https://github.com/MTank76/Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game.git
   ```
4. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.
5. Run the Python script `rock_paper_scissors.py`:
   ```
   python rock_paper_scissors.py
   ```
6. The game window will appear, allowing you to interact and play the game.

## Game Controls

- Enter your choice ('rock', 'paper', or 'scissors') in the provided text box.
- Click the 'PLAY' button to submit your choice and see the game result.
- Use the 'RESET' button to clear the input and result fields.
- The 'EXIT' button closes the game window.

## Development

The game is developed using Python and Tkinter. The logic involves generating a random choice by the computer and comparing it to the user's input to determine the winner. The interface elements, such as labels, entry fields, and buttons, are created using Tkinter widgets to provide a simple yet interactive user experience.

## Contributions

Contributions and enhancements to the game are welcome! Feel free to open issues for suggestions or submit pull requests for new features, bug fixes, or improvements.
